## The UX skills I’ve acquired

I’ve focused on skills that have the most utility in meeting user needs and business objectives.

- Conducting user interviews and usability testing, synthesizing data into actionable findings
- Using Figma to create responsive, component-based interfaces that can be easily translated into front-end code
- Iterating on designs through sketches, low-fidelity and high-fidelity prototypes
- Ideating on concepts with personas, scenarios, and user flows
