# Career Q & A

## How does working in UX fit into your career trajectory?

Like many people in UX, I’ve had experience in a handful of fields. My work has tended to center around people or technology. I’ve served in AmeriCorps, coached low-income students, and coordinated programs for a nonprofit. On the other side, I embraced my long-standing interest in technology by learning full-stack web development. I’ve come to realize that I do my best work at the intersection of people and technology. I consider it a good sign that as I learned more about UX I kept asking myself, “Why wasn’t I doing this all along?”

## What makes UX exciting for you?

I’ve always been multi-interested. Since UX combines methods from several fields, I’m excited by the prospect of using my technology, design, and social science skills. I also enjoy the role of creative problem-solving in design.

As digital experiences have improved, user expectations have risen. I appreciate the challenge of aligning business goals with creating products that seamlessly integrate into people's lives.

## How does your web development experience inform your UX work?

With my coding experience, I’ve been able to design interfaces that work with the capabilities of the web. This includes:

- Building components that follow naming and state conventions
- Understanding data retrieval and how data flows through an application
- Weighing the technical trade-offs of design decisions
- Integrating designs with libraries, frameworks, and design systems

## How is your customer service experience an asset to working in UX?

It’s one thing to know that customers have a problem, but it’s another to speak to customers _while_ they’re upset about a problem. While working on a large retailer’s customer service team, I learned about common pain points in e-commerce. Customers often have problems around site navigation, checkout, and payment methods. Despite their ubiquity, it's difficult to craft these features in a way that's intuitive to all users.

I’ve learned to ask customers the right questions to probe into their deeper needs and attitudes. Customer service reps have a strong sense of the most pressing issues a product faces, and they can report on these issues in near real-time.

A direct customer service line is something that many loyal customers highly value. But if more customers can help themselves, representatives can focus on complex tasks that truly require a human to fix.

## What skills did you build from recruitment and canvassing?

I recruited for an AmeriCorps program and canvassed for a statewide initiative. To spread my message, I had to quickly gauge people’s reactions to what I was saying. Then I adjusted my content and tone as necessary. In user interviews, it's essential to ask questions that will effectively check what people are thinking and feeling.

## What did you do while working for nonprofits?

In an AmeriCorps program, I served as a college access coach for a diverse group of high school students. During that time, I honed my ability to teach and break down complex topics. In interfaces, this has helped me clearly communicate core messages and concepts.

I also learned how to encourage productive participation in workshops and classes. It’s important to incorporate the insights of the product team into the design process, and workshops are a key way to achieve that.

Finally, I was a coordinator of a large program for a food bank. I built trust with key members of community organizations and helped them see the value in partnering with our program. I put these skills to use to advocate for the user-centered design process.

## What useful things did you learn in your formal education?

In college, I studied psychology and anthropology in a self-designed major. During that time, I learned how to:

- Conduct ethnographic field research
- Interview groups about sensitive topics
- Analyze data from quantitative research
- Recognize patterns of learning, perception, and cognition

Knowing these concepts allows me to research more accurately and design for how people think and work.
