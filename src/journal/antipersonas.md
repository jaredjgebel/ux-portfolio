<time datetime="{{ date | dateIso }}">{{ date | dateReadable }}</time>

An [antipersona](https://www.nngroup.com/articles/antipersonas-what-how/) is an artifact to viscerally think about product misuse and manipulation. Security is often considered from a code perspective, but it's an important concern for designers as well, especially as technology permeates our lives even more deeply. It's essentially another form of risk management to protect businesses and the people who use their products.
