# Flexible Product Roadmaps

<time datetime="{{ date | dateIso }}">{{ date | dateReadable }}</time>

I appreciated learning about a different take on product roadmaps on a recent episode of [Better Done Than Perfect](https://userlist.com/podcast/now-next-later-roadmapping-with-janna-bastow/). [ProdPad](https://www.prodpad.com/), a tool for PMs, incorporates a flexible approach to roadmaps (Now/Next/Later). It allows time for discovery and the inevitable speedbumps that occur in feature development. I'm curious to know if it has helped teams reduce design and technical debt as well.

Some things will almost always have firm deadlines, but this method of project planning seems straightforward and realistic.
