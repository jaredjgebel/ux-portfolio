The [last episode of Content Rookie](https://contentrookiepod.com/) was a noteworthy, unfiltered perspective on the difficulties in implementing tone and voice guidelines. These guidelines are very popular within UX writing at the moment, but the document may or may not have an actual audience. There's also the question of who will ensure that website and application copy follows the guidelines. It's a good reminder that design system artifacts aren't useful if they're not actually being used.
