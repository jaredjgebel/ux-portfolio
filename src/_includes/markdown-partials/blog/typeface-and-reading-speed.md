Jakob Nielsen [reviewed Adobe's study](https://www.nngroup.com/articles/best-font-for-online-reading/) of how typeface choice affects reading speed. The takeaway: we're not that close to parsing out all of the potential factors in font legibility, which likely include age, reading level, and context. After reading this, I have some questions about how typefaces can impact user and business value.

- Do users get more value from reading a typeface they enjoy versus one that helps them read the fastest?
- Is it more valuable to use a typeface that helps users remember a site's content or one that reinforces a unique brand identity?

Like most design decisions, it essentially comes down to trade-offs.
