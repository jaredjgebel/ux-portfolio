[Wireflows](https://www.nngroup.com/articles/wireflows/) combine wireframes and user flows to document how interactions trigger changes in content and layout over the course of a user task. This is particularly helpful for web and mobile apps, where single screens may have a range of dynamic content. It's an interesting example of customizing a deliverable to fit a specific use case, and a good reminder that deliverables aren't the end goal, but tools to communicate and reach a specific design outcome.
