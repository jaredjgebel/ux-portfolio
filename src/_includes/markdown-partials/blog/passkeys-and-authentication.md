I've come across websites and apps with passkeys (passwordless logins) a few times. However, until yesterday I didn't realize there was an organization (FIDO Alliance) committed to standardizing them. With many of the largest tech companies involved and the technology in place in most browsers, we're already in the midst of a giant shift around authentication. The organization provides [UX recommendations](https://fidoalliance.org/ux-guidelines/) for implementing passkeys.
