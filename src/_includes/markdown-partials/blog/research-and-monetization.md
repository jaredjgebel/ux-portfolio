John Kotowski [recently spoke on Better Done Than Perfect](https://userlist.com/podcast/product-monetization-with-john-kotowski/) regarding his approach to helping SaaS companies optimize their monetization models. It's notable that research is his first step in his process. Research can not only make a better product, but also better monetize the product. The research target isn't exactly the same as UX research - users vs. buyers - but in both cases if you're not starting from place of knowledge, you're starting from a place of weakness.
