## My approach

Products are driven by a variety of demands:

- User needs
- Stakeholder requirements
- Business context
- Market trends
- Technology stacks

â€“to name a few.

My forte is gathering and synthesizing information. I integrate what I learn about these factors into my design process.

My goal is to center the user while creating solutions that satisfy all stakeholders.
