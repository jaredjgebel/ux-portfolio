{% featuredSection "bg-primary-50" %}

I designed features for grain farmers to **track market prices** and **evaluate potential revenue outcomes**.

To address usability constraints, I reduced the need for data entry by **saving as much state as possible between views in the user flow**.

{% endfeaturedSection %}
