### The business problem

Grain farmers must sell their crops each year. But if grain prices are too low, an entire yearâ€™s work could fail to turn a profit.

To **maximize revenue** and **reduce financial risk**, farmers can use hedging strategies in the national commodities markets.

However, the **markets are volatile and difficult to understand**.

To **persuade farmers** to switch away from their current (often non-technological) workflows, I needed to design in a way compatible to their existing practices.

I couldn't offer a **strong value proposition** for the application until I had a thorough understanding of the market strategies farmers use to increase their revenue.
